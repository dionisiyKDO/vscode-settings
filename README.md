# vscode-settings
 My VSCode settings

 settings.json copied from ```../Code/User/settings.json```
 Just copy it back to ```../Code/User/settings.json```

 List of extensions got from command ```code --list-extensions > extensions.txt```
 Restore maybe with ```xargs -n 1 code --install-extension < extensions.txt```, not sure, haven't tested it
